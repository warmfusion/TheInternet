          <p>A really simple weekend project using some serious overengineering to create a black box with a blinky light.</p>

<p>List of components;</p>

<ul>
<li>2x 1.1K resistors</li>
<li>MSP430g2231 Microcontroller</li>
<li>1 Red LED (5mm)</li>
<li>AA Battery holder<br>
</li>
<li>Stripboard</li>
<li>Small wires(for jumpers)</li>
<li>Black Hobby Box</li>
</ul><p>I'd have liked a nice LED mount, but Maplin didn't have any available, so that might be a later improvement.</p>

<p>The Idea - Make a blinky box that matches the â€œfeelâ€ of The Internet from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDbyYGrswtg">IT Crowd</a></p>

<p>I wanted to create a properly wireless device, with as long life as possible. Originally planned to have a few solar cells for indefinite runtime, but I couldn't find any in my â€œSpare partsâ€ drawer. Instead, after failing to work out how proper electrical engineers do blinky things, settled on using a microcontroller. </p>

<p>Aside from being horribly overengineered, I can excuse myself by suggesting that it may be extended at later dates with some features like an RGB LED, LDRs etc. For nowâ€¦ <em>shrugs</em></p>

<p>Again, I needed it to be long lasting; I don't want to waste batteries on such a thing, so I spent some time looking at running the MSP430 in low power mode, along with some interrupt coding.</p>

<p>The code is available from my GitHub repository here: <a href="https://github.com/warmfusion/TheInternet">TheInternet</a></p>

<p>The basics are;</p>

<ul>
<li>Set the P1 ports to OUTPUT as this reduces current consumption on the MSP430 as it doesn't try and read any input </li>
<li>Turn on the input VLO oscillator ready to start counting</li>
<li>Ensure interrupts are going, and go into Low Power Mode 3 (LPM3)</li>
<li>After a delay, the interrupt is called, toggling the LED </li>
<li>As an addition, I change the cycle counter on each toggle so that the LED blink has a longer pause than the on time.</li>
</ul>

{"name":"Theinternet","tagline":"Low Power MSP430 code that blinks an LED to emulate The Internet box from IT Crowd","body":"A really simple weekend project using some serious overengineering to create a black box with a blinky light.\r\n\r\nList of components;\r\n\r\n* 2x 1.1K resistors\r\n* MSP430g2231 Microcontroller\r\n* 1 Red LED (5mm)\r\n* AA Battery holder  \r\n* Stripboard\r\n* Small wires(for jumpers)\r\n* Black Hobby Box\r\n\r\nIâ€™d have liked a nice LED mount, but Maplin didnâ€™t have any available, so that might be a later improvement.\r\n\r\nThe Idea - Make a blinky box that matches the â€œfeelâ€ of The Internet from the [IT Crowd](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDbyYGrswtg)\r\n\r\nI wanted to create a properly wireless device, with as long life as possible. Originally planned to have a few solar cells for indefinite runtime, but I couldnâ€™t find any in my â€œSpare partsâ€ drawer. Instead, after failing to work out how proper electrical engineers do blinky things, settled on using a microcontroller. \r\n\r\nAside from being horribly overengineered, I can excuse myself by suggesting that it may be extended at later dates with some features like an RGB LED, LDRs etc. For nowâ€¦ *shrugs*\r\n\r\nAgain, I needed it to be long lasting; I donâ€™t want to waste batteries on such a thing, so I spent some time looking at running the MSP430 in low power mode, along with some interrupt coding.\r\n\r\nThe code is available from my GitHub repository here: [warmfusion/TheInternet](https://github.com/warmfusion/TheInternet(\r\n\r\nThe basics are;\r\n\r\n* Set the P1 ports to OUTPUT as this reduces current consumption on the MSP430 as it doesnâ€™t try and read any input \r\n* Turn on the input VLO oscillator ready to start counting\r\n* Ensure interrupts are going, and go into Low Power Mode 3 (LPM3)\r\n* After a delay, the interrupt is called, toggling the LED \r\n* As an addition, I change the cycle counter on each toggle so that the LED blink has a longer pause than the on time.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
